            <p>Welcome to the Fashion MNIST Image Classification Project. In this project, we explore the process of
                building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the Fashion MNIST
                dataset.
            </p>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This project dives into the architecture of the model, the training process, and interpretability using
                LIME. Whether you are a beginner in deep learning or looking to implement image classification, this
                tutorial will guide you through the steps to create an effective and interpretable model.


                Data mining, machine learning and deep learning are being extensively used in today’s world across
                various sectors like e-commerce, fashion, automobile industry and others. With enormous data available
                in the fashion industry, there has beena rapid increase in the usage of the data science technologies in
                fashion e-commerce to address several problems like clothing classification, recognition, and
                recommendations. This paper presents various approaches to perform clothing classification using the
                Fashion MNIST dataset. The study aims to classify the images into ten categories. In this paper,
                classical machine learning algorithms like XGBoost and Random Forest have been used as baseline models
                to perform the classification. Deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are
                utilized to perform this image classification task. The paper also aims at the interpretability of these
                models predictions by using various methods including LIME and SHAP.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>After exploring the Fashion MNIST dataset and building a CNN model, we've gained insights into image
                classification techniques. The model's interpretability using LIME provides transparency, making it a
                valuable tool in real-world applications.</p>
